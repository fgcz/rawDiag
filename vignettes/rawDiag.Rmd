# Introduction

Over the past two decades, liquid chromatography coupled to mass 
spectrometry (LC–MS) has evolved into the method of choice in the 
field of proteomics. [@Cox2011, @Mallick2010] During a typical 
LC–MS measurement, a complex mixture of analytes is separated by a 
liquid chromatography system coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS) 
through an ion source interface. This interface converts the analytes 
that elute from the chromatography system over time into a beam of 
ions. The MS records from this ion beam a series of mass spectra 
containing detailed information on the analyzed sample. [@Savaryn2016] 
The resulting raw data consist of the mass spectra and their metadata, 
typically recorded in a vendor-specific binary format. During a 
measurement the mass spectrometer applies internal heuristics, which 
enables the instrument to adapt to sample properties, for example, 
sample complexity and amount of ions in near real time. Still, method 
parameters controlling these heuristics need to be set prior to the 
measurement. Optimal measurement results require a careful balancing of 
instrument parameters, but their complex interactions with each other 
make LC–MS method optimization a challenging task.

Here we present `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawDiag')`, a 
platform-independent software tool implemented in the R language [@newS] that 
supports LC–MS operators during the process of empirical method 
optimization. Our work builds on the ideas of the discontinued software 
*rawMeat* (VAST Scientific). Our application is currently 
tailored toward spectral data acquired on Thermo Fisher Scientific 
instruments (raw format), with a particular focus on Orbitrap 
[@Zubarev2013] mass analyzers (Exactive or Fusion instruments). These 
instruments are heavily used in the field of bottom-up proteomics 
[@Aebersold2003] to analyze complex peptide mixtures derived from 
enzymatic digests of proteomes.

`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawDiag')` is meant to run after MS acquisition, 
optimally as an interactive R shiny application, and produces a series 
of diagnostic plots visualizing the impact of method parameter choices 
on the acquired data across injections. If static reports are required 
then pdf files can be generated using
`r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('rmarkdown')`. In this vignette, we present the 
usage of our tool.

`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawDiag')` gains advantages from being part of
the Bioconductor ecosystem, such as its ability to utilize the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawrr')` package and potentially extend its
functionality through interaction with the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('Spectra')`
infrastructure, particularly with the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('MsBackendRawFileReader')`.

# Requirements

`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawDiag')` proides a wrapper function `readRaw` using the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawrr')` methods `raw::readIndex`, `rawrr::readTrailer`,
and `rawrr::readChromatogram` to read proprietary mass spectrometer generated
data by invoking third-party managed methods through a `system2`
`text connection`.
The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawrr')` package provides the entire stack below,
which `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawDiag')` utilizes.

# Install

## OS dependencies
### Linux (debian/ubuntu)

In case you prefer to compile `rawrr.exe` from C# source code, please install
the mono compiler and xbuild by installing the following Linux packages:

```
sudo apt-get install mono-mcs mono-xbuild
```

Otherwise, to execute the precompiled code, the following Linux packages are
sufficient:

```
sudo apt-get install mono-runtime libmono-system-data4.0-cil -y
```

### macOS (Catalina/BigSur)

```
brew install mono
```

or install from

https://www.mono-project.com/

### Microsoft Windows

Running the `rawrr.exe` will run out of the box.

If the native C# compiler is not available install mono from:

https://www.mono-project.com/

## R

To install this package, start R (version ">=4.4") and enter: 

```{r installRawrr, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("rawrr")
```

assemblies aka Common Intermediate Language bytecode - the download and install
can be done on all platforms using the command:

```{r checkRequirements}
rawDiag::checkRawrr
rawDiag::checkRawrr()
```


for more information please read the INSTALL file in the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawrr')` package.

# Usage

## R command line

### Input

fetch example Orbitrap raw files from
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('ExperimentHub')`'s `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('tartare')`
package.

```{r fetchFromExperimentHub}
library(ExperimentHub)
ExperimentHub::ExperimentHub() -> eh
normalizePath(eh[["EH3222"]]) -> EH3222
normalizePath(eh[["EH4547"]]) -> EH4547

(rawfileEH3222 <- paste0(EH3222, ".raw"))
if (!file.exists(rawfileEH3222)){
  file.copy(EH3222, rawfileEH3222)
}

(rawfileEH4547 <- paste0(EH4547, ".raw"))
if (!file.exists(rawfileEH4547)){
  file.copy(EH4547, rawfileEH4547)
}

c(rawfileEH3222, rawfileEH4547) -> rawfile
```
Of note, the *proprietary* .Net assemblies [@RFR] require a file extentention of `.raw`. Therfore we have to rename the EH files and add the `.raw` suffix.

list meta data of the raw files.

```{r header}
(rawfile |>
  lapply(FUN = rawrr::readFileHeader) -> rawFileHeader)
```

### `readRaw` - read Orbitrap raw file 

read the two instrument raw files by using the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawDiag')`
package.

```{r readEH4547OrbitrapTrailerTable}
rawfile |>
  BiocParallel::bplapply(FUN = rawDiag::readRaw) |>
  Reduce(f = rbind) -> x
```

### Output -  Visualization

This package provides several plot functions tailored toward MS data. 
The following list shows all available plot methods.

```{r listFUN}
library(rawDiag)
ls("package:rawDiag") |>
  grep(pattern = '^plot', value = TRUE) -> pm

pm |>
  knitr::kable(col.names = "package:rawDiag plot functions")
```

An inherent problem of visualizing data is the fact that depending on the data
at hand, specific visualizations lose their usefulness, e.g., overplotting in
a scatter plot if too many data points are present. To address this problem, we implemented most of the plot functions in different versions inspired by the
work of @Cleveland1993, @Sarkar2008, and @Wickham2009. The data can be displayed
in trellis plot manner using the faceting functionality of
`r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('ggplot2')`. Alternatively, overplotting using color
coding or violin plots based on descriptive statistics values can be chosen,
which allows the user to interactively change the appearance of the plots based
on the situation at hand. For instance, a large number of files are best
visualized by violin plots, giving the user an idea about the distribution of
the data points. On the basis of this, a smaller subset of files can be selected
and visualized with another technique.

The code snippet below applies all plot methods on the example data.

```{r plotALL, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
pm |> 
  lapply(FUN = function(plotFUN) {
    lapply(c('trellis'), function(method) {
      message("plotting", plotFUN, "using method", method, "...")
      do.call(plotFUN, list(x, method)) 
    })
  }) 
```

The appearance of each plot depends on the instrument, sample, and method used
to acquire the data. Therefore, it is hard to say what each ideal plot should
look like. 
In particular, in the example above, we use data generated on an
`r rawFileHeader[[1]]$"Instrument name"`, `r rawFileHeader[[1]]$"RAW file"` and
`r rawFileHeader[[2]]$"Instrument name"`, `r rawFileHeader[[2]]$"RAW file"`
instrument using data-independent acquisition (DIA) [@Bruderer2017] and
data-dependent acquisition (DDA) methods.
For more information on the plot methods and its application, please read the
package man pages and the application examples in the manuscript
[@Trachsel2018].

## Launching the shiny application

The package provides a simple interactive `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('shiny')`-based
graphical user interface for exploring Thermo Fisher Scientific *raw* data.

If you have a directory containing raw files, you can create a shiny application
as follows:

```{r shinyApp}
rawfile |>
  dirname() |>
  rawDiag::buildRawDiagShinyApp() -> app
```

The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('shiny')` runApp function launches the app in our
browser.

```{r runApp, eval=FALSE}
shiny::runApp(app)
```

By default, the application lets you choose the raw files in the provided
directory and provides the visualizations of the raw data as output.
The user can interactively change the by the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('rawDiag')`
the package provided plot functions and arguments.

Additionally, the application provides PDF generation and download buttons.
Optionally height and width can be changed in the user interface.

Of note, the `rawDiag::rawDiagServer` module can be integrated into an existing
`r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('shinydashboard')` application, e.g., https://shiny-ms.fgcz.uzh.ch/fgczmsqc-dashboard/.

# FAQ

## I would like to load multiple files into a single data.frame to do comparisons; what is the preferred method for doing so?

consider all raw files of your working directory, e.g., `~/Downloads` and load them.

```{r FAQ1, eval=FALSE}
file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), "Downloads") |>
  setwd()

list.files() |>
  grep(pattern = '*.raw$', value = TRUE) |> 
  lapply(FUN = rawDiag::readRaw) |> 
  Reduce(f = rbind) -> x
```

as alternative to `lapply` you can utilize the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('BiocParallel')` package `bplapply` function.
