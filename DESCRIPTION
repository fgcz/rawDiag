Description: Helps with quality checks, visualizations 
    and analysis of mass spectrometry data, coming from proteomics 
    experiments. The package is developed, tested and used at the Functional 
    Genomics Center Zurich 
    (Trachsel C. (2018) <doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00173>).
    We use this package mainly for prototyping, teaching, and having fun with
    proteomics data. But it can also be used to do data analysis for small scale
    data sets.
